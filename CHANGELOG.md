# Changelog

## Transactional

### 1.0.51
* Added `maxBodyLength` and `maxContentLength` configurations to axios in order to prevent failures with `Request body larger than maxBodyLength limit` error message

### 1.0.50
* Added a response parameter to /messages/send and /messages/send-template called 'queued_response' that details why an email was queued.

### 1.0.48
* Allowing users to schedule messages (using messages/send, messages/send-template, messages/send-raw and messages/reschedule APIs) within a year from the date of scheduling.

### 1.0.46
* Added a little more granularity to the `set_timeout` method to the Client class in the Ruby SDK; now supports `read`, `write` and `connect` parameters, which will default to the `timeout` param if unspecified, or 300 seconds if `timeout` is unspecified.

### 1.0.45
* Added a `set_timeout` method to the Client class in the Ruby SDK

### 1.0.44
* Added a `set_timeout` method to the Client class in the Python SDK

### 1.0.43
* Added a `setTimeout` method to the Configuration class in the PHP SDK.

### 1.0.42
* Added a `setDefaultTimeoutMs` method to the node client. This allows users to override the default timeout for API requests, which is set to 5 minutes by default.

### 1.0.41
* Updated the "reject_reasons" response for /messages/send and /messages/send-template to correctly use "hard-bounce" and "soft-bounce" instead of the previously stated "hard_bounce" and "soft_bounce".

### 1.0.40
* Added the new /allowlists/ series of endpoints and the /exports/allowlist endpoint to the API reference

### 1.0.39
* Fixes the output directory for the Changelog for the php client library

### 1.0.38
* A change was made to `mailchimp-transactional-php` - the API client will now always return an `Exception`, instead of an `Exception` or a string, when the API returns an error. Having to parse the response as a string was found to be a bit clunky.

### 1.0.37
* Added a changelog, which will be used to describe changes to both transactional and marketing client libraries.

### 3.0.72
* Updated the `PATCH /automations/.../emails/.../` documentation to state the required `workflow_type`
